# cms-gallery
Display a lightbox gallery from images added in the seven49.net CMS.

In the backend insert a text element with <code>@Start Gallery ThumbnailWidth == 300</code> before the gallery images and then choose your gallery images with the image elements.

Include somewhere above your javascript file <code>&lt;script src=&quot;http://cdn.seven49.net/common/js/jquery/seven49/cmsGallery-1.0.min.js&quot; &gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> and  initialise the gallery  in your javascript file with <code>cmsGallery();</code>

The script will take care of all other details.
